# Ubuntu 24.04 for riscv64

Normally I grab my riscv docker (oci) images from http://hub.docker.com/r/riscv64/ubuntu/tags but so far they don't have an image for Ubuntu 24.04 and I need it do build some stuff.

So I created this quick Dockerfile to build an Ubuntu24.04 image.

Note: If they release and image, or if canonical starts publishing official images, I might archive this project and leave the containers without updates!
